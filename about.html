<h1>About Page</h1>
<p>I created this page as a local hiker to share the trails, views and outdoor experiences that make this such an incredible place to explore. My adventures are mostly centered around the Logan area where even short walks can lead to amazing scenery. I built this site as a simple way to document my own hiking journeys and to help others discover trails that are safe, approachable, and rewarding. Here you'll find trial write-ups, photos, tips, and honest notes from someone who's still learning and exploring right alongside you. I hope this site helps you feel excited and confident about getting outdoors.</p>
